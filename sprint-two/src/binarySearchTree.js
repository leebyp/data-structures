function breadthFirstLog(func){

	Enqueue the root node
	Dequeue a node and examine it
	If the element sought is found in this node, quit the search and return a result.
	Otherwise enqueue any successors (the direct child nodes) that have not yet been discovered.
	If the queue is empty, every node on the graph has been examined â€“ quit the search and return "not found".
	If the queue is not empty, repeat from Step 2.

}

	Note: Using a stack instead of a queue would turn this algorithm into a depth-first search.
